## How to use the bot
### Prerequisites:
* Ensure **Python 3** is installed on your machine. If not, download it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). To see if python is on your machine, go to your terminal and type ``python3 --version``. If ``Python 3.xx.x`` does not appear, you do not have Python or you do not have the correct version of Python.
* Installing **Git** is neccessary for this program. Install git [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads). To see if you have git, go to your terminal and type ``git --version``. If ``git version ...`` does not appear, you do not have Git.
* You must have **Google Chrome** installed for this application to work. Install chrome [here](https://www.google.com/chrome/).

### Step 1: Install the Program
* **With Git**: Within your terminal, go to where you want your application to be stored and enter ``git clone -b macOS-Ease-of-Access --single-branch https://github.com/Dylan-Wimoth/TimeSheetBot.git``

### Step 2: Installing Requirements
* Open the folder in finder and click on the .DMG file. Then drag both items into your applications folder. ***Note:*** This file is password protected so ask either ``Dylan Wilmoth`` or ``Cary Gerhardt`` via webex for it.

### Step 3: Running the Program

After copying both files to your applications folder. Right click on the file ``TimeSheetBotRunner.sh`` and click open. There should be a pop up providing a warning saying this program is not apple signed. Click open anyways and the program should install any dependencies needed for the bot to run properly.

### Step 4: Credentials Error

If you recieve a credentials error please let ``Cary Gerhardt`` or ``Dylan Wilmoth`` know so we can add you to the email list
